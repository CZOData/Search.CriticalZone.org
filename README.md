This repositiory is for bug and issue tracking and for the Critical Zone Observatory Data Portal at http://search.criticalzone.org/.

The CZO Portal is built upon a framework and visual design shared with us by the West Coast Ocean Data Portal (WCODP, http://portal.westcoastoceans.org/), a project of the West Coast Governors Alliance on Ocean Health (WCGA, http://www.westcoastoceans.org/). Their original code is available on GitHub at https://github.com/Ecotrust/wc-data-registry. We appreciate their assistance answering questions about the framework.

Funding for Critical Zone Observatories and the CZO Data Portal has been provided by the US National Science Foundation (NSF).
