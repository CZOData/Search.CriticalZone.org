# Search.CriticalZone.org
This repositiory is for bug and issue tracking and for the Critical Zone Observatory Data Portal at http://search.criticalzone.org/.

THE CZO Data Portal enables rapid exploration and filtering of the many datasets used by the US NSF Critical Observatories program (http://criticalzone.org/national). These data span a wide range of disciplines in earth, environmental, and biological sciences.

The Portal is based solely on extensive metadata, which includes pointers to data files. The files themselves are stored elsewhere, mostly on servers at the 10 individual CZO observatories.

CZO data can be searched simultaneously alongside related, non-CZO data collections like ‘LiDAR data of the US’ from OpenTopography.org. All Portal content is available as multiple web services via our API access (http://search.criticalzone.org/api).

The CZO Portal itself is built upon a framework and visual design shared with us by the West Coast Ocean Data Portal (WCODP, http://portal.westcoastoceans.org/), a project of the West Coast Governors Alliance on Ocean Health (WCGA, http://www.westcoastoceans.org/). Their original code is available on GitHub at https://github.com/Ecotrust/wc-data-registry. We appreciate their assistance answering questions about the framework.

Funding for Critical Zone Observatories and the CZO Data Portal has been provided by the US National Science Foundation (NSF).
